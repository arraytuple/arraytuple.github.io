### Meta Chatracters 
```
.        Matches any single character
\        Escapes one of the meta characters to treat it as a regular character
[...]    Matches a single character or a range that is contained within brackets. Order does not matter but without brackets order does matter
+        Matches the preeceding element one or more times
?        Matches the preeceding element zero or one time
*        Matches the preeceding element zero or more times
{m,n}    Matches the preeceding element at least m and not more than n times
^        Matches the beginning of a line or string
$        Matches the end of a line or string
[^...]   Matches a single character or a range that is not contained within the brackets
?:...|..."Or" operator
()       Matches an optional expression
```

### A reasonable example :

- `[^ ]+` matches everything except for a space one or more times as there is `+`
- [a-z]+ means anything between `a and z` one or more times 
- `.` matches any character. see the wierd results of pattern1 


```python
import re 

text = """ this is the email avaanish@iitk=com adddress ,
njdcnjkd and there is example@nknxs.coim pimple@example.com  """

# the dot matches any character not only one dot 
pattern1 = re.compile("[^ ]+@[^ ]+.[a-z]+")   

# need to put a \ before dot to make any meta char act like a dot 
pattern2 = re.compile("[^ ]+@[^ ]+\.[a-z]+")

pattern3 = re.compile("[^ ]+@[^ ]+\.com") 

matches1 = pattern1.findall(text)
matches2 = pattern2.findall(text)
matches3 = pattern3.findall(text)

print(matches1)
print(matches2)
print(matches3)

Out : 
['avaanish@iitk=com adddress', 'example@nknxs.coim pimple']
['example@nknxs.coim', 'pimple@example.com']
['pimple@example.com']

```

### Extract Urls from text 

- `?`        Matches the preeceding element zero or one time
- `*`        Matches the preeceding element zero or more times
- `?:...|...`  "Or" operator
- `()`   matches an optional expression

```python
content = """http://google.com
https://example.com
http://www.wikipedia.com
http://pythonhow.com
https://python.org
"""


pattern = re.compile("https?://(?:www.)?[^ \n]+\.(?:com|org)")
matches = pattern.findall(content)
matches

Out : ['http://google.com',
 'https://example.com',
 'http://www.wikipedia.com',
 'http://pythonhow.com',
 'https://python.org']

```

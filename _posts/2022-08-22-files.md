A csv file is just a flat file. There is common misconception where csv files are thought to be related to excel files. They do open with excel when they have csv as the suffix as they lead to better human readability that way. But they can be opened in a text editor like notepad also.  

Bottomline : a csv file is a text file where the values are comma separated. Infact when you read that file , you will get a single string as the output. 

```python 
with open("file.csv" , "r") as file:
    content =  file.read()         
    
Out : 'account_num,balance\n12456,2000\n56785,5000'    
```
